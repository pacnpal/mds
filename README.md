# mds

Utilities for reading and converting .mds/.mdf disk image files

This tool converts .mdf/.mds files into .iso or .cue/.bin files. I wrote this
since I found that `mdf2iso` was creating bad images for some discs that I
tried, and the iso file format cannot handle multi-track images at all.

This program reads from `.mds` files, which are binary metadata files that
describe the contents of their accompanying `.mdf` files. This is in contrast to
`mdf2iso`, which attempts to parse the type of disc image out of the mdf data
file itself. That said, you will need the .mds metadata file to use this
program.

## Installation

If you want to compile from source, use `cargo build` and the standard
toolchain.

Pre-built binaries are available on [the releases page](https://github.com/delta62/mds/releases).

## Usage

### Printing mds metadata

Run `mds info <my_file.mds>` to view the contents of an mdf image

```
# mds info my_file.mds
/home/sam/my_file.mds

### Converting to iso

Run `mds convert --format iso <my_image.mds>` to convert the contents of an mdf to an iso
file. Note that iso files can only contain one track, so if you have a
multi-track mdf you'll need to convert to a different format.

### Converting to bin/cue

Run `mds convert --format cue <my_image.mds>` to convert the contents of an mdf to bin
and cue files. This format does support multiple tracks.
