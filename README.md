Utilities for reading and converting .mds/.mdf disk image files

> **Fork notice:** This is a fork of [delta62/mds](https://github.com/delta62/mds).
> It adds an `mds extract` subcommand that reads files straight out of an `.mdf`
> without producing an intermediate ISO (Joliet-aware, with path-traversal and
> symlink guards). The ISO conversion path also carries fork fixes over upstream:
> correct cooked-sector extraction from raw-mode tracks, MODE2/2336 (0x920)
> handling, and seeking to the track start offset before reading.

This tool converts .mdf/.mds files into .iso or .cue/.bin files. I wrote this
since I found that `mdf2iso` was creating bad images for some discs that I
tried, and the iso file format cannot handle multi-track images at all.

This program reads from `.mds` files, which are binary metadata files that
describe the contents of their accompanying `.mdf` files. This is in contrast to
`mdf2iso`, which attempts to parse the type of disc image out of the mdf data
file itself. That said, you will need the .mds metadata file to use this
program.

## Installation

If you want to compile from source, use `cargo build` and the standard
toolchain.

Pre-built binaries are available on [the releases page](https://github.com/pacnpal/mds/releases).

## Usage

### Printing mds metadata

Run `mds info <my_file.mds>` to view the contents of an mdf image

```
# mds info my_file.mds
/home/sam/my_file.mds

```

### Converting to iso

Run `mds convert --format iso <my_image.mds>` to convert the contents of an mdf to an iso
file. Note that iso files can only contain one track, so if you have a
multi-track mdf you'll need to convert to a different format.

### Converting to bin/cue

Run `mds convert --format cue <my_image.mds>` to convert the contents of an mdf to bin
and cue files. This format does support multiple tracks.

### Extracting files

Run `mds extract <my_image.mds>` to read files straight out of an mdf without
producing an intermediate iso. The default output directory is the .mds basename
(e.g. `PMagic_8/` for `PMagic_8.mds`); override it with `-o <DIR>`. Joliet
(Unicode) names are preferred when the disc has a supplementary volume
descriptor; otherwise the primary ISO9660 names are used.

```bash
mds extract my_image.mds                 # write files to ./my_image/
mds extract my_image.mds -o out/         # write files to ./out/
mds extract my_image.mds --list          # print the tree, write nothing
mds extract my_image.mds --force         # allow writing into a non-empty dir
```

Only single-track data discs are supported. For multi-track discs, convert to
bin/cue first.
